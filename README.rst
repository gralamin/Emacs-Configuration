===========================
Gralamin's Config for emacs
===========================

This config is based off of `prelude
<https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude>`_. In my opinion, Bozhidar Batsov
went too far.  A lot of the content of this is based off my own
workflow. I want to  to use the same keys for copy and paste
everywhere, even if it limits power.

Included is everything required to work much as I do. Customize
personal if there is anything you feel is missing.
